# Finding the needle in the haystack: Identifying rare particles at the future Electron-Ion Collider
This project uses machine learning algorithms to identify a specific type of particles that could be created and potentially be observed in rare (one in 100 million) events at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The EIC which will collide electrons with protons at nearly the speed of light to explore the structure and inner dynamics of protons and atomic nuclei. For a general introduction and overview of the EIC, see for example this [EIC fact sheet](https://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/fact_sheet/pdf/EIC_Brochure.pdf). Here, we are searching for a particularly rare phenomenon, the conversion of the colliding electron into a tau lepton, in simulated EIC data. Such a conversion is predicted by various theories, and the discovery of this process would significantly expand our understanding of nature.

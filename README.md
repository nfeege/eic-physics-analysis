# Finding the needle in the haystack: Identifying rare particles at the future Electron-Ion Collider
This project uses a simple cut-based approach and machine learning algorithms to identify taus. Taus are particles that could be created and potentially observed in rare (one in 100 million) events at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The EIC will collide electrons with protons at nearly the speed of light to explore the structure and inner dynamics of protons and atomic nuclei. If experiments at the EIC can effectively identify taus while eliminating background, they could search for a particularly rare phenomenon, the conversion of the colliding electron into a tau lepton. Such a conversion is predicted by various theories, and the discovery of this process would significantly expand our understanding of nature.

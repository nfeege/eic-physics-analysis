# Electron Ion Collider (EIC) Physics Analysis

These projects are related to my research on specific physics topics and experiment design for a future Electron Ion Collider (EIC). For a general introduction and overview of the EIC and its goals, see for example this [EIC fact sheet](https://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/fact_sheet/pdf/EIC_Brochure.pdf).

### Finding the pencil in the haystack: Identifying rare phenomena with an experiment at the Electron Ion Collider
This project aims to categorize different types of phenomena that could potentially be observed with an experiment at the proposed Electron Ion Collider (EIC), which will collide electrons with protons at nearly the speed of light. We are searching for a particularly rare phenomenon, the conversion of electrons into tau leptons, which would profoundly change our understanding of nature.
